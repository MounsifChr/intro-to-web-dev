{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"title":"Introduction","description":"Introduction to the course."},"html":"<h2 id=\"who-is-this-course-for--prerequisites\">Who is this course for / Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Hopefully you!</p>\n<p>This course will teach you HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All three are necessary components to start making modern web apps. If you need help in any of these categories, this course should be helpful.</p>\n<p>This course is also for your friends!! This course, both this website and the video, are free to everyone thanks to the fine folks at <a href=\"https://www.frontendmasters.com\">Frontend Masters</a>! Free!? What&#39;s the catch? The catch is that Frontend Masters makes content for developers to get better at their jobs and by you becoming a developer you are now in their target audience. Big brain stuff!</p>\n<h2 id=\"set-up\">Set up</h2>\n<p>This course works and has been tested on both macOS and Windows 10. It also will work very well on Linux (just follow the macOS instructions). You shouldn&#39;t need a particularly powerful computer for any part of this course. 8GB of RAM would more than get you through it and you can likely get away with less.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you do not have to use <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>, it is what I will be using and I&#39;ll be giving you fun tips for it along the way. I was on the VS Code team so I&#39;m a bit biased!</li>\n<li>People often ask me what my coding set up is so let&#39;s go over that really quick!<ul>\n<li>Font: <a href=\"https://www.monolisa.dev/\">MonoLisa</a>. Be sure to <a href=\"https://worldofzero.com/posts/enable-font-ligatures-vscode/\">enable ligatures</a> in VS Code! If you want ligatures without Dank, check out Microsoft&#39;s <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code\">Cascadia Code</a>.</li>\n<li>Theme: I actually just like Dark+, the default VS Code theme. Though I do love <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl\">Sarah Drasner&#39;s Night Owl</a> too.</li>\n<li>Terminal: I just switched back to using macOS&#39;s built in terminal. <a href=\"https://iterm2.com/\">iTerm2</a> is great too. On Windows I love <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab\">Windows Terminal</a>.</li>\n<li>VS Code Icons: the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons\">vscode-icons</a> extension.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"expectations\">Expectations</h2>\n<p>Okay, so let&#39;s set some expectations.</p>\n<p>This course is hard. It&#39;s frustrating. You are going to hit the wall, multiple times. That&#39;s okay. It&#39;s expected. Do not get down on yourself.</p>\n<p>Very importantly, <strong>DO NOT COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS</strong>. You have a perfect knowledge of your own shortcomings and an imperfect understanding of their achievements. You will always underestimate yourself and overattribute progress to others. You are on a very personal journey and the way you get through it is to take one step at a time and monitor your own progress and have some patience and perservence.</p>\n<p>Don&#39;t start playing the &quot;should&quot; game with yourself. &quot;I should get this&quot;, &quot;I should understand this by now&quot;, &quot;I should not be stumbling like this&quot;, etc. are all very dangerous games. There is no &quot;should&quot; here, just where you are now. This is a trap all new coders fall into.</p>\n<p>The most comparable thing I have ever done to learning to code is learning a foreign language. I am American and thus grew up speaking English. When I graduated high school (secondary school) I went to live in Italy. It tooks months of hard work and practice before I could even order a drink at the coffee shop. It tooks months more before I felt like I could have a fluent conversation about the weather or where I&#39;m from. It took months more before I could talk about politics or other specialized topics. You do not learn a language overnight. It takes months of work and practice. But the payoff is amazing!</p>\n<p>Whoa, okay, so you mean I&#39;m not going to be writing sonnets in iambic pentameter in JavaScript at the end of this course? No, you won&#39;t. You&#39;ll learn how to read and write complete statements for sure, but what&#39;s important you are going to learn how to teach yourself how to code. You&#39;re going to learn how to learn. This is the trailhead on the journey of learning how to code. Some of you will learn all you need to know about coding; you could absolutely code up the landing page to your local business from this course, even how to connect something like Stripe to take orders. But if you want to get a job at Microsoft, Netflix, Google, and the like, there&#39;s more work ahead. It&#39;s possible. You just have to stick to it!</p>\n","slug":"intro","title":"Introduction","section":"Welcome to the Class","icon":"info-circle","filePath":"/home/runner/work/intro-to-web-dev/intro-to-web-dev/lessons/01-welcome-to-the-class/A-intro.md","nextSlug":"/intro-to-web-dev/lessons/welcome-to-the-class/get-set-up","prevSlug":null}},"__N_SSG":true}
